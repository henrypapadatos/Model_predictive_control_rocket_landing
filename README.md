# Model_predictive_control_rocket_landing
The goal of this project is to design an MPC controller to control a rocket prototype with controlable trust direction. 

We first linearise the dynamics and use a linear MPS controller.
And then we directly use a non linear MPC controller and compare the results.

The final goal of the project was to track a path formed by the letters "MPC" in the air. 

Here is a snapchot of our tracking performances.

This project was realised in the scope of the "Model predictive control" class (ME-425) thaught by Jones Colin Neil.
