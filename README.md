# Model_predictive_control_rocket_landing
Design an MPC controller to control a rockect with controlable trust direction

# Remarks report

## Deliverable 2.1

- Sys_z "depends only on z and vz" only if the rocket is aligned with z, i.e. not bended 
- Sys_roll -> same

## Deliverable 3.1
- I put a different horizon for each subsystem maybe put the same horizon for all subsystems as did henry in his part
- Maybe similar cost matrices as henry, I mean it is strange to have different matrices for similar problems (actually not that similar as henry added soft contraints + no terminal set !!, we should maybe explicitly justify the difference) + terminal set !!


## Deliverable 6

Do we talk about non linear cost functions ??
